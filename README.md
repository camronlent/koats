# KoaTS
My frustration between trying to learn Koa and trying to understand the typescript type definitions has led me to create this project. I intend to reimplement Koa and some ancillary packages with the aim of understanding. Along the way, I want to document what I learn. I tend to dislike crucial design decisions that are usually entirely justified so who knows what the future holds here. It's intended for personal use, but take anything you want!

## Examples
There are no examples, because I've only just begun...
